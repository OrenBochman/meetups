- Go is one of the languages I use at work
- I program in Go in my spare time
- I love Go
- Worked with it for a while / Love/hate relationship / Willing to use

* Agenda

- Go and testing
- Go and HTTP
- Go and HTTP and testing
- Go and Websockets
- Go and Websockets and testing
- What is missing
- Solution
- The `net.Pipe` challenge

* Everybody loves testing

From the survey:

* Go + tests = <3

- Seriously, go was built so you could test your code easily
- ... Super easily
- `testing` package in the standard library
- `go test` tool as part of the `go` command line
- Benchmarks
- Run tests in parallel
- Coverage as a standard tool
- + a lot more...

* Go + HTTP Server = Big <3

HTTP Handler interface (sinners are frameworks who wrap it)

    type Handler interface {
        ServeHTTP(ResponseWriter, *Request)
    }

You get a strong and concurrent web server out of the box!

Example:

.play handler/handler.go /^func main/,/^}/

[[http://localhost:8080/Go]]
[[http://localhost:8080/Stratoscale]]

* Go + Testing + HTTP Servers > 3

`httptest.NewServer` option:

.play newserver/main.go /^func main/,/^}/

`httptest.NewRecorder` option:

.play recorder/main.go /^func main/,/^}/

Unless you have a very good reason, prefer the second.

* Websockets:

- Give full duplex communication. (Instead of polling / long polling)
- Low messages overhead
- Use existing http/s ports: good for strict firewalled environments.
- Ride over existing http/s protocol.

* Websockets Basics:

HTTP handshake:

- Request:

    GET /ws HTTP/1.1
    Upgrade: websocket
    Connection: Upgrade
    ...

- Response:

    HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
    Upgrade: websocket
    Connection: Upgrade
    ...

--> TCP based Full duplex communication

* Websockets in Go

* Example: echo server

.code echo/handler.go /^func Handler/,/^}/

* Test it?

- Use the httptest.NewServer!

.play websocket-newserver/main.go /^func main/,/^}/

* Test it?

- Use `httptest.NewRecorder`?

    Not possible!

- Why do we want something like `httptest.NewRecorder`?

* Let's build it together!

We want to achieve something of the form:

    d := NewTestDialer(http.HandlerFunc(echo.Handler))
    c, resp, err := d.Dial("ws://whatever/ws", nil)

- Use the gorilla's `webscoket.Dialer.NetDial` field:

    NetDial: func(network, addr string) (net.Conn, error)

- Use `net.Pipe` that returns two paired connections:

    client, server := net.Pipe()

.link https://golang.org/pkg/net/#Conn net.Conn interface
.link https://golang.org/src/net/pipe.go?s=461:485#L8 net.Pipe implementation

* Let's build it together!

.code build/main.go /^func NewTestDialer/,/^}/

* recorder: implements ResponseWriter + Hijacker

.code build/main.go /RECORDER START OMIT/,/RECORDER END OMIT/

* Works?

.play build/main.go /^func main/,/^}/

* panic: set pipe: deadline not supported

Actually: net.Pipe fails the `nettest.TestConn` tests.
.link https://github.com/golang/net/blob/master/nettest/conntest.go#L37 TestConn tests net pipes implementations

.code nettest/netpipe_test.go /^func TestNetPipe/,/^}/

==> Fails

Let's write a net.Pipe that supports deadlines!

* The challenges

- Read/Write methods blocks, how do you cancel them?

My solution:

- `bytes.Buffer` which is not blocking, returns EOF error on read when empty
- `sync.Cond` for notifying on new content in pipe
- After write: signal.
- After deadline: set error and broadcast.
